# wordle-candidates
A script for finding the solution to the daily [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Just give the script a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) based on the clues you've got and the matching words will be printed to the terminal.

On Linux you can use egrep instead: ```cat words.txt | egrep '{regular expression}'```
